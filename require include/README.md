# CIS94---require-include-template

#Include allows both functions to be called globally

#A syntax error shows just as if the function was part
#of the original file

#After multiple refreshes the require_once() doesn't seem to
#effect the file any differently other than having to require the file to run.

#require doesn't allow the program to run unless the file is found
